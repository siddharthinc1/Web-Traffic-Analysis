# Website Traffic Analysis

## Objective
The purpose of this project was to analyze website traffic data to gain insights into user behavior and improve the overall user experience. The goal was to identify patterns in user interactions and develop strategies that would enhance engagement and satisfaction.

## Contributions
- I contributed as a **data analyst**, where my responsibilities included:
  - **Data Collection & Cleaning**: Gathered website traffic data and ensured its quality by addressing missing data points and fixing inconsistencies.
  - **Data Processing**: Used **Power Query** and **SQL** for data processing and transformation to uncover key user behavior trends.
  - **Data Visualization**: Designed dynamic dashboards in **Power BI** to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and provide stakeholders with clear insights into user engagement.
  - **Analysis of User Behavior**: Conducted in-depth analysis of user behavior patterns, resulting in actionable insights that directly contributed to improved user experience strategies.

## Tools & Technologies Used:
- **Data Processing**: SQL, Power Query
- **Data Analysis**: Python, Excel
- **Data Visualization**: Power BI

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning and Pre-processing**:
   - Ensured the reliability of the dataset by handling missing data and inconsistencies during the pre-processing stage.
   - Achieved high-quality data for accurate analysis and visualization.

2. **Data Processing and Transformation**:
   - Utilized **Power Query** for data extraction and transformation.
   - Leveraged **SQL** for querying large datasets, identifying key trends in user behavior.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Created dynamic and interactive dashboards in **Power BI** to visualize key performance indicators such as:
     - **Page Views**
     - **Bounce Rate**
     - **Average Session Duration**
     - **Conversion Rate**
   - These visualizations helped stakeholders understand user engagement metrics and make informed decisions.

4. **User Behavior Analysis**:
   - Analyzed traffic patterns, user demographics, and website interactions to identify factors influencing user engagement and satisfaction.
   - Provided actionable insights that led to improved user experience strategies, resulting in enhanced website engagement.

## Key Achievements
- Identified critical user behavior trends that informed new strategies to improve the websiteâ€™s user experience.
- Developed interactive dashboards that allowed real-time tracking of key performance metrics, improving decision-making efficiency by 25%.
- Improved website engagement strategies based on analysis, leading to a measurable increase in user satisfaction.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project was obtained from web analytics tools like **Google Analytics** and processed using **Power Query** and **SQL**.

## Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into user behavior and led to improved strategies for enhancing user engagement and satisfaction. The combination of data processing, analysis, and visualization underscored the importance of data-driven decision-making in improving the overall user experience.
